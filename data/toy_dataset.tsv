4	31-Jul-18	Walnut Finish 	"Sometimes while playing a game, you can answer a question correctly but Alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you.  I like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home."	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, i control the lights and play games like categories. Has nice sound when playing music as well."	1

5	31-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can’t wait to see what else it can do."	1
3	31-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet."	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.	1

5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times	1

5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound	1
4	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask	1
3	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Amazing product	1
